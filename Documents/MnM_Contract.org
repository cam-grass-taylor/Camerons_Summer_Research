* Summer Goals and Commitments
This form outlines the goals for your research this summer, your personal learning goals for the summer, and other useful information.

* Research Goals
Dr. Schneider and I set these. At the end of the summer you should be able to tell us the following:

1. What is clustering?
2. How have zeolites been clustered before?
3. How do zeolites cluster according to different ring or T-site descriptors?

While answering the questions in the Research Goals section, you will likely learn some of the following:

- Zeolite information?
  - What are they used for?
