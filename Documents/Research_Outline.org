* Summer Goals and Commitments
This form outlines the goals for your research this summer, your personal learning goals for the summer, and other useful information.

* Research Goals
Dr. Schneider and I set these. At the end of the summer you should be able to tell us the following:

1. What is clustering?
2. How have zeolites been clustered before?
3. How do zeolites cluster according to different ring or T-site descriptors?

* Deliverables
1. Written report with your findings.
   - Written like a research paper.
     - Background, methods, results, conclusions.
2. Presentation to the group
   - There is no need to be stressed about this, all the group members are helpful and nice.
   - I've messed up so many presentations, and no one cares.
   - This is your chance to show off how much you have learned. 
* Personal Goals
Understand the code used to determine how many rings are in the structures. Discern if I enjoy research and if it is a potential career path. Become proficient at coding and learn some more chemistry. 

* Things You Will Learn Along the Way
While answering the questions in the Research Goals section, you will likely learn some of the following:

- Zeolite information?
  - What are they used for?
  - What are the made of
    - What are tetrahedral and oxygen sites?
  - What is a ring in a zeolite?
    - What are the different ways researchers define rings? 
- Python
  - You are going to learn so much Python coding
  - How to read and parse files in Python
  - How to use some basic data science techniques in Python
  - Math in Python
  - Plotting
- Git
  - You will learn version control and information sharing via Git
  - Cloning repositories
  - Push changes to repositories
- How to work with a research group
- Self guidance and self motivation due to remote working

* Meeting Information
We can update this as the summer goes along, but we can start here.

- Weekly meetings between Cameron and Jerry to take place via Zoom.
  - Day/time TBD
- Cameron will attend Schneider Group meetings
  - Monday and Friday check ins at 10 AM EDT
  - Wednesdays Zeolites sub-group meeting 9 AM EDT
- Cameron and Dr. Schneider meetings:
  - This can get filled in accordingly, I'm not sure what works best for you two.
